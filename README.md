# Obscene Vocabulary Checker

Today, many popular platforms on the Internet use artificial intelligence to filter out offensive comments and posts. Building such a filter requires a lot of skill and knowledge. There is another way to hide obscene words in the comments. Of course, it is not as effective as artificial intelligence, but it will do the job. The Obscene Vocabulary Checker is a simple console program that finds certain words and replaces them with ******.

### Work with files, strings, slices, conditional statements, and loops.

You can check sentences and replace the words that you find in the dictionary with ****.
Note that the number of * corresponds to the number of characters in a certain taboo word.
The input can include a sentence where the words start with a capital letter. 
The vocabulary checker functions case insensitive.
ToDo: Punctuation signs count as part of the words. 
A future version of this program might disregard the punctuation.
